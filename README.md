# ElectionSystem
election system created using springmvc

in this system we have two types of user first one is admin user and second is guest user.

admin user can add candidates for election and can start or stop election process.
whereas on other hand guest user can vote for any candidate to make that candidate win that election if election's are in progress 
if elections are over than that user can check out the results as which user won election.
